# ig-trading-sentiment-cloudflare-worker-fetch-db

Javascript Cloudflare Worker that acts as an API to fetch data from a Cloudflare serverless D1 database and pass it to a frontend application for display.

A Cloudflare Worker was chosen for this project because the usage will fall well within the Cloudflare free tier so the project is free to run.
